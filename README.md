<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Training project testing MyDemoApp mobile app from Saucelabs, using core testing tools such as Java, the Carina framework, and Appium. The testing process is integrated with Jenkins and using TestRail to provide a comprehensive testing experience.

The goal of the project is to improve testing skills and gain experience in mobile app (iOS and Android) testing.

Through this project the application's capability of delivering high-quality service to its users will be ensured. In order to achieve this goal, a comprehensive testing plan will be put in place to assess the application's functionality. Tests will be conducted at various stages of the development process, from unit testing to integration testing, to ensure that the application is fully functional and bug-free. 

Additionally, testing will be done across multiple platforms and devices to ensure that the application is compatible with a wide range of systems.
